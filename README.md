# Emal Fiza's Interactive Quiz Game

Interactive Quiz Game: 

I always wonder if teachers think to themselves, “How much do my students already know about this topic” before they begin teaching a particular topic to their students.

I hope they really do for the simple reason that it will help them shape their teaching strategy. And, an effortless way to understand this, is assigning your students an online interactive quiz.

Interactive quizzes ask a series of interactive questions to the users that assess how much they know on a particular topic. Assigning interactive quizzes is much more fun and exciting way for your students to engage in the classroom, and plays to their curiosity.

An interactive quiz is a knowledge test centered around a particular topic. An interactive quiz aims to not only measure knowledge levels but also to initiate conversation and enable equal exchange of information.

The answers come with instant feedback and remarks that are valuable. They are interesting as the quiz takers don’t have to wait for the results to arrive or tally up their points like a paper-based test.

Emal Fiza's Interactive Quiz Game is consists of 3 subjects: 
1. Physics
2. Maths 
3. General Knowledge

Each subject contains 10 intermediate questions along with 4 options which is only one correct among them. Once a user finishes answering 10 questions, a piechart will pop up presenting the user the stats of his/her correct and incorrect answers.

# UX

-----

My goal in the design was to create a simple and clear quiz game website to be both informative and freindly enabling the user and easy access to the quiz game content on the site whilst aiming for a minimalist design.
For users, I wanted to provide them with an intermidiate level of knowledge about physics, maths and general knowledge overview of Kabul and its culture via a simple, friendly and interactive design.
